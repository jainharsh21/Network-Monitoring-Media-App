# Rajasthan Studio Assignment

## About the App

### Feedback

Due to the hectic schedule I am having currently, I wasn't able to do the viewing favourites part.

Although it is very easy to implement, we can use shared preferences to store the photos/videos marked by the user...and show them in the screen I have created. This way we won't need a seperate database as it is going to be stored in the app data itself.

Also, I felt that using BLoC for this assignment would not be a good idea as it has limited number of screens and its recommended not to use it unless we have data updating across multiple screens.

Proper folder structure has been maintained.
