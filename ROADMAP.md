# Improvements

1) The UI and UX could be made more aesthetic using existing packages.
2) We can create models for the data of video and photos we are getting from api for better access.
3) We can use cached network image to cache the images as we are getting them from network, it would load much faster.
4) Favourites can be implemented using shared preferences rather than a database, this would allows us to cut costs and make it much more faster.
5) A better offline page can be shown,in case the user doesn't have an active interet connection.
6) Users can post their own images/videos and share it with the public.
7) Commenting and sharing the media to support the artist.
8) Display the profile of the artist using the webview since we are getting the url of the artist.
